        this request queues a new VM creation. Most of the keys in config 
        are self-explanatory the one noteworthy is networks however. it is 
        a map of nics (provided by the dataset) to UUIDs of networks (
        not ip ranges!).

        This is the same as the normal Create an VM request however it stops 
        before sending the request to the hypervisor. So no VM is ever created 
        however it does check if the VM could be created.
        It needs to be noted that both false positives and false negatives 
        can occur so this is a good approximation but should not be taken as 
        a definite. False positive are more likely then false negatives.

        The following files are created in LeoFS:
        <vm-uuid>/<backup-uuid> - the gzip compressed ZFS snapshot
        <vm-uuid>/<backup-uuid>.xml - the zone config XML file from /etc/zones/<vm-uuid>.xml
