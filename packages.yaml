        Creates a new package
        Requirements
        'requirements' is an array of objects as with the following atributes:
        'WEIGHT'
        A number (positive or negative) or the string "most", "cant" for strong
        enforcement or "scale" and "random" must, cant, and <number> rules
        This rules simply compare an attribute of the hypervisor against a 
        value and either enforces a the rule (must/cant) or gives out points, 
        both positive and negative to rate the found hypervisors.
        attribute
        The attribute to check on the hypervisors, this can be a json like 
        path so for example "characteristics.colour" will look up colour in 
        the hypervisors characteristics
        Value
        The value to check against, this can be a number, a string, or an array.
        condition
        One of:
        >=, > - Checks if the value of attribute is larger (or equal) to the 
        value
        =<, < - Checks if the value of attribute is smaller (or equal) to the 
        value
        =:= - Checks if the value of attribute is equal to the value
        =/= - Checks if the value of attribute is not equal to the value
        "subset" - Checks if the value of attribute is a subset of value 
        (requires value to be an array)
        "superset" - Checks if the value of attribute is a subset of value 
        (requires value to be an array)
        "disjoint" - Checks if the value of attribute is a subset of value 
        (requires value to be an array)
        "element" - Checks if the value of attribute is a subset of value 
        (requires value to be an array)
        "allowed" - Checks if the value of attribute is a subset of value 
        (requires value to be an array)
        scale rules
        This rules linearly map an attributes value onto a given scale and 
        give the result as points for hypervisor selection.
        attribute
        The attribute to check on the hypervisors, this can be a json like 
        path so for example "characteristics.cores" will look up cores in the 
        hypervisors characteristics This must be an numeric value towork
        low, and high
        The lowest and highest number of the scale, to map against.
        random ruleS
        This rules simply generate a random number on a given scale, this 
        allows making non deterministic rules. The resulting number is used 
        as points for hypervisor selection.
        low, and high
        The lowest and highest number the random number is generated from.
